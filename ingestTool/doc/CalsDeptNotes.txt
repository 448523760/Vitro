Use a RelationResolver with name matching and a 
StringPreprocessor to map CALS Impact Dept fields
to vivo organization names.

Or how about breaking the code that gets the
other ent id out into it's own method and 
override that?

Odd, non-deptartment found in CALS Dept field:
Cooperative Extension (ADM) -> 759?
Cooperative Extension (NYC) -> 759?
