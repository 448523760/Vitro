put in vivo.

In biosis we get the following fields:

* Abstract (AB)
* Accession Number (AN)
* Author Address (AD)
* Author Email (EMA)
* Author, Editor, Inventor (AU)
* Book Author, Editor (AUB)
* Book Publisher (PB)
* Book Source (BK)
* Full Text (FTXT)
* Language (LA)
* Links to Library Holdings (WEBLH)
* Meeting Information (MT)
* Publication Year (PY)
* Source (SO)
* Title (TI)
* Update Code (UD)

The first program that gets a turn at the data is the BiosisLoad
program.  For each record it check to see it there is already one
there using the title string.

Basicly these get mapped to the fields of the pubs table.

Irregularities:
There is some stuff with booktitle, title, bookpublisher. not sure
what it is.

Something stuff happens with fullTextLinks and fullTextSources. These
fields get cut up
