;;;from running BiosisLoad in regression testing.

;;;If you are making changes to the code you could download a batch
;;;of articles, run the load, copy the log/xxx.log to log/xxx.log.baseline

;;;log/xxx.log to log/xxx.log.baseline to see if you broke anything.

;;;The base line files should not be checked into source control.
