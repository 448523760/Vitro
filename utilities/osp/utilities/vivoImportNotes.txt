Notes on Importing OSP grant award data into VIVO
Brian Caruso
20040106

There are 4 tasks:
a) Taking the data about a single award and sticking it into a VIVO
entities record.

b) Associating this record with a department.

c) Associating this record with the Sponsors, creating the sponsor if none
exists.

d) Associating this record with PI's/COPI's and creating them if they
don't exist.

a) Awards (etype 117)
How to populate the VIVO.entities row:
id				auto increment
typeid			117 (research grant)
name			award_prop_full_title
description		?
modTime			?
timekey			?
How do we record the time frame of the award? sunrise-sunset?

b) Departments (etype 61)
This should just be a ents2ents record.  There should be a 
osp table where we have the OSPdeptNames and the VIVOdeptNames:

OSPdeptNames			VIVOdeptNames
---------------------	----------------------------
ANIMAL SCIENCE			Animal Science
PLANT PATHOLOGY-GENEVA	Plant Pathology at Geneva

This table will be used to map OSP depts to VIVO depts.
pros: simple, static, clear code
cons: if there is a new dept it breaks (abort?, prompt for VIVO dept?)

c) Sponsors
How do we match sponsors with entities?  This is becoming a common
problem eg biosis author names, osp depts, etc.

d) PI's and COPI's 
Match up using netid's, How do we get a person entity using a netid
from VIVO?  There are no netid's in VIVO?
Etypes: Cornell academic staff (etype id 94), cornell faculty (etype id
31), cornell librarian (etype id 32), non-cornell faculty(etype id
90).
